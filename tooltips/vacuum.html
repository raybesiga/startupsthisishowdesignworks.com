<p>Jonathan (Jony) Ive, Senior Vice President of Industrial Design at Apple, is a good friend of our new pal Dieter Rams, and takes inspiration from Braun's minimalist aesthetic and focus on function.

Apple has managed to achieve what I never achieved: using the power of their products to persuade people to queue to buy them.”<sup>2</sup> </p>
